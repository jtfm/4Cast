# 4Cast
4Cast is a simple single-page website intended to display the current weather conditions of anywhere around the world.

How does it work?

It sends a query to the Open Weather API based on text input of location or GPS coordinates provided by the web browser. jQuery is then used to display an icon and textual information about the weather. The background images are from Pixabay and will roughly correspond to the conditions and whether it is night or day.
