# What's the weather like?

This is a simple single-page website intended to display the current weather conditions of anywhere around the world.

***How does it work?***

It sends a query to the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org) based on text input of location or GPS coordinates provided by the web browser. jQuery is then used to display an icon and textual information about the weather. The background images are from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/) and will roughly correspond to the conditions and whether it is night or day. This project was inspired by one of FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate FrontEnd Development Projects (https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and forms part of an application to Founder's and Coder's June 2017 Javascript course in London (http://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/).

Notes:

 - Currently works in Firefox and Opera, though not Chrome due to its insistence on https. 

Possible future developments:

 - get https to play nicely with the script
 - crop background images nicely when under a certain window size
 - display local time wherever the weather is looked up rather than the time as recorded by the user's browser

Possible Mission Creep:

  - 5 day forecasts
  - Wind speed and direction icon
